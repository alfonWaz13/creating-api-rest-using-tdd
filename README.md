# 🧪 TDD User API

This is a small project to practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** by building a simple **CRUD API** for user 
management.

I'm following a video series by [pmareke](https://github.com/pmareke/pmareke), available on 
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J07x_uO7RE&list=PLsG63TbtJ1zu6H1Yh3tqmBbLTiPTQe4vD), where he builds an API 
using TDD principles. The goal here is to apply the same workflow and get practical experience writing tests first, 
then implementing the code.

## 📌 Features

- 🧍 Create a user  
- 🔍 Retrieve a user or list of users  
- ✏️ Update user information  
- 🗑️ Delete a user

The focus is on learning and applying TDD, not building a full production-grade API.
